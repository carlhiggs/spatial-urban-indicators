Boundaries were matched with alternate spellings in both Thai and English for corresponding regions found in data from other organisations  and datasets  (e.g. NSO, HDX) in order to facilitate data linkage.   The final boundary layer was returned to BMA and agreed upon for usage. ","District and changwat boundaries were constructed through geometrical union of the constituent subdistricts they were aligned with.  Boundaries at all three scales (subdistrict, district, changwat) were imported into the project database and used as analysis areas when constructing other indicators, as required.  The area in square kilometres of each analysis area's polygonal extent was recorded.   The changwat (province) of Bangkok was used to define the Bangkok metropolitan study region extent.  A ten kilometre buffer extending beyond this is used when conducting analyses of access to resources, so that access to destinations outside the study region would be accounted for peri-urban regions when undertaking network analysis.

On the other hand, some other districts had a high ratio of tests to establishments.  This data context is important to remember when interpreting the data (for example, out of 1/1592 samples in Chatuchak did not pass insecticide quality standard testing, and so for this standard the target of 100% was not achieved; the comparison with Khan Na Yao where 1/1 tests passed does not in itself provide a fair comparison for food quality in the two districts).","2.1, 3, 11",./data/Thai/_from BMA/20191204/transfer_1815206_files_409fa2da/BKK_ Food quality testing_2018_19_kn20191114.xlsx,Cleaned_Combined,integer,,,,20191204,none specified,,area summary,district,Total number of food quality tests conducted,,#,,,,"overall, area:1, population:10000, household:10000",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only Chatuchak (6 schools) achieved an overall average of greater than 50.  However, it should be noted that district averages do not necessarily reflect individual school performance (some districts have more than 20 schools), and within schools it is expected that there may be considerable heterogeneity.  Furthermore, estimates of the average score may be influenced by poor performing outlying students, and alternate measures such as the median may be more appropriate as a summary of central tendency.

The final boundary layer was returned to BMA and agreed upon for usage.

Boundaries at all three scales (subdistrict, district, changwat) were imported into the project database and used as analysis areas when constructing other indicators, as required.  The area in square kilometres of each analysis area's polygonal extent was recorded.   The changwat (province) of Bangkok was used to define the Bangkok metropolitan study region extent.  A ten kilometre buffer extending beyond this is used when conducting analyses of access to resources, so that access to destinations outside the study region would be accounted for peri-urban regions when undertaking network analysis.
