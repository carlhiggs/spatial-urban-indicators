discussed,Walkability,average score,Average walkability score (relative to city),"Possible discussion: We usually calculate using z-scores relative to the city --- in theory though, we could standardise across cities so cities can be more appropriately compared"
discussed,Transport,% of population,"Access  to any public transport, within mode specific distance",need to discuss mode specific distances in international context
discussed,Transport,% of population,"Access to any frequent public transport (serviced every ? minutes on a normal day), within mode specific distance",pending data availability of GTFS data; need to discuss mode specific distances in international context
proposed,Transport,ratio,full road network (km) to pedestrian network (km) ,proposed feasible alternative to ratio of roads (km) to footpaths and cycle lanes (km)

proposed,Density,% of non-urban fringe population,within 1.2km of activity centres and public transport hubs,Need to discuss definitions
proposed,Destinations,% of population ,Access to destinations required for daily living (excluding PT),"Need to discuss international context of daily living destinations, and how we represent using OSM"
discussed,Open space,% of land area ,allocated to open space,Need to discuss definition of open space with regard to OSM (ie. confirm we agree on HLC approach in national context)
proposed,Open space,% of population ,access to public open space,Additional measure which could be of interest (pending POS definition)
