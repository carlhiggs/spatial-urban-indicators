As indicators are calculated we plan to deliver previews of both the data and maps using the data.

There are four folders in the zip file

html - contains interactive maps as html files, with links to data sources and their licences
png  - maps (static images, based on the styling of the interactive maps)
gpkg - a geopackage containing the data used to make the above maps (administrative boundaries, associated with population data and indicators based on these)
QGIS - contains a QGIS document with relative path to the geopackage file, and maps for the four main indicators (population, population density, subdistrict population relative to district, subdistrict population relative to Bangkok)

To use the QGIS file, please ensure QGIS is installed (https://qgis.org/).

As the project progresses, we envisage expanding on this documentation further.
