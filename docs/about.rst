Meeting the challenges of the 21st century---climate change, population growth and migration, the rise of non-communicable disease, increasing inequalities---will require coordinated, global efforts across multiple sectors and levels of government. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a global framework for promoting human development and wellbeing, reducing inequalities, and tackling these challenges in an environmentally sustainable manner. Cities will play a central role in meeting these aspirations; indeed, SDG 11 specifically calls for sustainable, socially inclusive, and resilient cities that promote wellbeing. In doing so, the SDGs recognise the importance of cities given the trends toward population growth and urbanisation: already, half the world's population lives in cities, and by 2050 this will rise to more than two-thirds. 

Urbanisation acceleration is fastest in cities within low-to-middle income countries, and globally, Asia is urbanising most rapidly. Well-designed, liveable cities are essential for providing infrastructure that supports economic activity, governance, commerce and trade, while providing access to health and social services, education, and civic opportunities.

Liveable cities are also sustainable cities: they prioritise sustainable modes of transportation (e.g. walking and cycling) over carbon-intensive dependence on automobiles. 

However, rapidly urbanising cities face a number of challenges. Urban sprawl, environmental degradation, waste production and management, and noise, air and water pollution are major concerns for these cities and their residents. Consequently, there is urgency to increase understanding, capacity, and strategies that enhance liveability in low-to-middle income cities which go beyond Australian-centric definitions.

These issues are also central to the SDGs and promoting wellbeing. For example, access to sanitation and clean drinking water (SDG 6) is critical to promoting residents' wellbeing and impacts on the liveability of an urban area; yet, Australian liveability definitions do not include access to sanitation or drinking water.

This Partnership Project will extend a knowledge sharing and capacity building partnership between RMIT University, United Nations Global Compact-Cities Programme, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and the Victorian Government Department of Health and Human Services, by building on the ‘Contextualising Liveability in Bangkok’ Pilot Project findings.  We will further refine our knowledge of context-specific liveability in a rapidly urbanising low-to-middle income city context (Bangkok, Thailand). This will involve development and application of a suite of open source liveability indicators aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals with the aim of developing long-term local capacity. It is anticipated that this proof of concept will likely be scalable and relevant to other cities globally.

The aims of this project are to:

1. Identify and source open source liveability spatial data inputs and indicators aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and suitable for use in the Bangkok context;
2. Apply and test conceptually relevant liveability indicators across Bangkok;
3. Develop the capacity of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration for utilising liveability data in policy and planning; and
4. Generate translational outputs that maximise the useability and scalability of indicators for application for different cities.
