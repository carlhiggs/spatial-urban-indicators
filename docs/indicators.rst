Sentinel-5P NRTI NO2: Near Real-Time Nitrogen Dioxide
-----------------------------------------------------

Google Earth Engine was used to process Sentinel 5p data from the Copernicus satellite detailing total vertical column of NO2 (ratio of the slant column density of NO2 and the total air mass factor), taking the annual average from 13 October 2017 (commencement of the S5P monitoring mission) to 12 October 2018.  

**Data source**: Copernicus Sentinel Data processed using Google Earth Engine

**URL**: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_NRTI_L3_NO2

**Publication year**: 2019

**Target year**: 2018

**Acquisition date (yyyymmdd)**: 20191009

**Licence**: Free, full and open access for lawful usage, with attribution

**Licence URL**: https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/690755/Sentinel_Data_Legal_Notice

**Spatial reference (EPSG code)**: 4326.0

**Date type**: raster:float64

**Scale / Resolution**: 10

**Notes**: Free access, but must acknowledge Copernicus Sentinel, year of data and if it has been modified.  Requires processing, as data is in half hourly updates.

Annual average NO2 (Copernicus, 2017-18)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The total vertical column of NO2 is a measure of air pollution, however it is based on tropospheric and stratospheric presence of NO2 and measured in mmol per square metre; in contrast, health guidelines for exposure are usually based on ground monitoring of NO2, recorded in parts per billion.  As a spatially continuous measure, annual average NO2 is useful for indicating areas of relatively intense pollution and may be compared with ground based measures (ie. from monitoring stations) as well as longitudinally to monitor change over time.  For mapping purposes, NO2 was scaled as 1-e6 mmol per square metre (ie. divided by 0.000001).

High quality air
||||||||||||||||

อากาศคุณภาพสูง

"Air quality" refers to the weather conditions within the area around us. High quality air quality is at a level that is clean, clear and free from pollution such as smoke, dust, gas etc.  Human health, plants, animals and natural resources are threatened when air pollution reaches a high concentration.  Poor air quality affects or is harmful to human health and / or the environment.

Water quality/pollution

คุณภาพน้ำ/มลพิษทางน้ำ

Water quality refers to the physical, chemical, biological and sensory properties (taste) of water. Water pollution means the presence of toxic chemicals in groundwater and biological substances that are more than is found in natural water and may pose a threat to human health and / or the environment.


Canal water quality
-------------------

Data at district level were prepared by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and supplied as an Excel workbook.  The data comprised sample point records of canal water quality for 130 canals where Dissolved Oxygen (DO) less than 2 amount 130 canals (224 storage points).  Data were cleaned for processing and aligned with area IDs.

Mass transportation system Means a public transportation system in the metropolitan area, usually consisting of buses subway and elevated trains.   Convenient public transportation access means transportation systems that officially stop and send within 0.5 km of the reference point, such as homes, schools, workplaces, markets, etc. With additional characteristics as follows:  A) Public transportation can reach people with special needs, including people with physical disabilities and / or hearing impairments, including people with temporary disabilities. The elderly, children and others in vulnerable situations;  B. Frequent public transport services during peak travel times;  C. Stations or stops showing a safe and convenient environment

Fraction of Vegetation Cover
----------------------------

A modelled fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER, V2) 1km grid data product based on Copernicus satellite imagery targetting 20 December 2018 was downloaded in NetCDF (.nc) format.  Using the ESA SNAP software, a GeoTiff (.tif) excerpt was taken for the Bangkok region.  Band 1 of this satellite data product represents the fraction of vegetation cover.  Data values ranging from 0 to 250 are to be transformed to a 0 to 1 range to represent the fraction of vegetation cover within each grid portion.  Cell values of 255 represent no data, and were excluded.

Vegetation Percent (Copernicus, 2018; standard deviation)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The estimated standard deviation of percentage of vegetation cover within each analysis area was calculated by first scaling the raster grid cell values by 100/250 ( a scale factor of 0.4) and then taking the standard deviation of all intersecting grid cells.  This is a measure of the degree to wich estimates vary across a particular area, and is a useful contextual measure to accompany the average vegetation percent for the area.

Or paid according to the work done by the employee during normal working hours of the working day and shall include the money that an employer pays to an employee on holidays and days off for which the employee does not work.  Fair wage means the wage rate for an employee under the national wage laws such as the minimum wage. Pay Overtime pay Holiday pay Social security payment etc.  Cost of living means the cost of a person or goods used to purchase goods and services according to the type and quantity needed for living, such as home expenses.  The Gini coefficient is defined as a ratio between 0 and 1. The low Gini coefficient shows equality in income distribution. If this value is higher, it will indicate an increasingly disparate income distribution. Gene's coefficient equal to 0 means absolute equality (Everyone has the same income) and 1 means complete inequality. (There is only one person with income. The rest of the people have no income at all). The Gini coefficient calculation is based on the assumption that no one has a lower income than zero.

Public Transport

Supermarket locations identified through key-value pair tags according to OSM guidelines or common usage patterns identified from OSM Taginfo were analysed for accessibility using a pedestrian network derived from OSM data using OSMnx.

Percentage of residents living 800 metres distance of a supermarket (OSM, 2019)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Accessability within 800m was evaluated using the Python network analysis package Pandana for a series of sample points generated every 50 metres along the Bangkok OSM pedestrian network.   Population weighted averages for the proportion of sample points having access in each subdistrict were used to estimate the measure.  [method to be further updated]

Opportunity to earn a fair wage
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

โอกาสในการมีรายได้จากการทำงานอย่างยุติธรรม

"Wage" means the money that an employ and the employees agreed to pay compensation according to the employment contract for normal working hours on a daily, weekly, monthly, or other period. Or paid according to the work done by the employee during normal working hours of the working day and shall include the money that an employer pays to an employee on holidays and days off for which the employee does not work.  Fair wage means the wage rate for an employee under the national wage laws such as the minimum wage. Pay Overtime pay Holiday pay Social security payment etc.  Cost of living means the cost of a person or goods used to purchase goods and services according to the type and quantity needed for living, such as home expenses.  The Gini coefficient is defined as a ratio between 0 and 1. The low Gini coefficient shows equality in income distribution. If this value is higher, it will indicate an increasingly disparate income distribution. Gene's coefficient equal to 0 means absolute equality (Everyone has the same income) and 1 means complete inequality. (There is only one person with income. The rest of the people have no income at all). The Gini coefficient calculation is based on the assumption that no one has a lower income than zero.
  


Poverty Indicators 2017
