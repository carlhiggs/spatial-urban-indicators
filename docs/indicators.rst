Indicators
==========


Study region boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bangkok subdistrict boundary data (BMA, 2019) were topologically corrected using GRASS and QGIS, to ensure polygon boundaries did not have gaps or overlaps.  Boundaries were matched with alternate spellings in both Thai and English for corresponding regions found in data from other organisations  and datasets  (e.g. NSO, HDX) in order to facilitate data linkage.   The final boundary layer was returned to BMA and agreed upon for usage. 

**Data source**: BangkokGIS (BMA)

**URL**: http://www.bangkokgis.com/bangkokgis_2008/userfiles/files/download/shapefile/administration/BMASubDistrict_Polygon.rar

**Publication year**: 2018

**Target year**: 2018

**Acquisition date (yyyymmdd)**: 20190725

**Licence**: none specified

**Spatial reference (EPSG code)**: 32647.0

**Date type**: vector

**Scale / Resolution**: subdistrict

**Notes**: English names not provided; these have been derived using manual linkage with data from HDX subdistricts and population data provided by BMA, with verification from Kornsupha Nitvimol of BMA.

**Data location relative to project folder**: ./data/Bangkok_subdistricts_BMA_HLC_derived_20190805_cleaned_final.gpkg:subdistricts

District and changwat boundaries were constructed through geometrical union of the constituent subdistricts they were aligned with.  Boundaries at all three scales (subdistrict, district, changwat) were imported into the project database and used as analysis areas when constructing other indicators, as required.  The area in square kilometres of each analysis area's polygonal extent was recorded.   The changwat (province) of Bangkok was used to define the Bangkok metropolitan study region extent.  A ten kilometre buffer extending beyond this is used when conducting analyses of access to resources, so that access to destinations outside the study region would be accounted for peri-urban regions when undertaking network analysis.

Population and communities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Population statistics targetting Bangkok in 2018 were received from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, indexed by subdistrict. Fields included total population, sex strata, household, number of communities, and population in communities.  

**Data source**: BMA

**URL**: http://www.bangkok.go.th

**Publication year**: 2019

**Target year**: 2018

**Acquisition date (yyyymmdd)**: 20190805

**Licence**: none specified

**Scale / Resolution**: subdistrict

**Notes**: Derived population layer based on data received from Korn Nitviminol (BMA) via e-mail on 5 August 2019

**Data location relative to project folder**: ./data/Bangkok_subdistrict_population_BMA_HLC_derived_20190808.csv

Population data were linked with boundaries using corresponding subdistrict ID numbers.  Density measures were calculated using population statistics relative to analysis area size.

Sentinel-5P NRTI NO2: Near Real-Time Nitrogen Dioxide
-----------------------------------------------------

Google Earth Engine was used to process Sentinel 5p data from the Copernicus satellite detailing total vertical column of NO2 (ratio of the slant column density of NO2 and the total air mass factor), taking the annual average from 13 October 2017 (commencement of the S5P monitoring mission) to 12 October 2018.  

**Data source**: Copernicus Sentinel Data processed using Google Earth Engine

**URL**: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_NRTI_L3_NO2

**Publication year**: 2019

**Target year**: 2018

**Acquisition date (yyyymmdd)**: 20191009

**Licence**: Free, full and open access for lawful usage, with attribution

**Licence URL**: https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/690755/Sentinel_Data_Legal_Notice

**Spatial reference (EPSG code)**: 4326.0

**Date type**: raster:float64

**Scale / Resolution**: 10

**Notes**: Free access, but must acknowledge Copernicus Sentinel, year of data and if it has been modified.  Requires processing, as data is in half hourly updates.

**Data location relative to project folder**: ./data/International/Google EarthEngine/copernicus_s5p_nrti_l3_no2-mean_col_num_density_20171013_20181012.tif


Annual average NO2 (Copernicus, 2017-18)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The total vertical column of NO2 is a measure of air pollution, however it is based on tropospheric and stratospheric presence of NO2 and measured in mmol per square metre; in contrast, health guidelines for exposure are usually based on ground monitoring of NO2, recorded in parts per billion.  As a spatially continuous measure, annual average NO2 is useful for indicating areas of relatively intense pollution and may be compared with ground based measures (ie. from monitoring stations) as well as longitudinally to monitor change over time.  For mapping purposes, NO2 was scaled as 1-e6 mmol per square metre (ie. divided by 0.000001).

Fraction of Vegetation Cover
----------------------------

A modelled fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER, V2) 1km grid data product based on Copernicus satellite imagery targetting 20 December 2018 was downloaded in NetCDF (.nc) format.  Using the ESA SNAP software, a GeoTiff (.tif) excerpt was taken for the Bangkok region.  Band 1 of this satellite data product represents the fraction of vegetation cover.  Data values ranging from 0 to 250 are to be transformed to a 0 to 1 range to represent the fraction of vegetation cover within each grid portion.  Cell values of 255 represent no data, and were excluded.

Vegetation Percent (Copernicus, 2018; mean)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The estimated percentage of vegetation cover within each analysis area was calculated by first scaling the raster grid cell values by 100/250 ( a scale factor of 0.4) and then taking the mean (average) of all intersecting grid cells.

Vegetation Percent (Copernicus, 2018; standard deviation)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The estimated standard deviation of percentage of vegetation cover within each analysis area was calculated by first scaling the raster grid cell values by 100/250 ( a scale factor of 0.4) and then taking the standard deviation of all intersecting grid cells.  This is a measure of the degree to wich estimates vary across a particular area, and is a useful contextual measure to accompany the average vegetation percent for the area.

Aligns with Sustainable Development Goals: 3, 11, 13, 15.

Supermarket locations identified through key-value pair tags according to OSM guidelines or common usage patterns identified from OSM Taginfo were analysed for accessibility using a pedestrian network derived from OSM data using OSMnx.

Percentage of residents living 800 metres distance of a supermarket (OSM, 2019)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Accessability within 800m was evaluated using the Python network analysis package Pandana for a series of sample points generated every 50 metres along the Bangkok OSM pedestrian network.   Population weighted averages for the proportion of sample points having access in each subdistrict were used to estimate the measure.  [method to be further updated]
